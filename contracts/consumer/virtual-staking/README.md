# Virtual Staking Contract

This contract is responsible for interfacing with the [virtual staking sdk module](../../../docs/consumer/GoModule.md)
and minting and burning and delegating actual tokens to match the requests of the provider.

It is defined in more detail [in the architecture documentation](../../../docs/consumer/VirtualStaking.md). The rest of this
readme should focus on the usage.

**TODO**: Add more details about the usage of the contract.
