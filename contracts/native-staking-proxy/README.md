# Native Staking Proxy

This can only be understood in the context of the [native-staking contract](../native-staking).
Basically, it allows a per-user proxy to hold that user's stake. It allows the user full control
of the stake, including restaking and voting, and will trigger a release on the vault when the stake
is fully unbonded.
