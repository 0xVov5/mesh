# External Staking

An external staking contract connects to a [Vault](./Vault.md).
It manages staking and staking the vault's (virtual) tokens to the remote protocol,
and releases the virtual tokens when finished unbonding.

It also manages distribution of rewards coming from the remote (consumer) chain,
and transferring of those rewards to remote recipients on the consumer chain.

**TODO** flesh this out
