# Mesh Security

An implementation of Sunny's [Mesh Security](https://youtu.be/Z2ZBKo9-iRs?t=4937) talk from
Cosmoverse 2022.

Please check out the [architectural documentation](./docs/README.md), which gives a
thorough view of all the components in a completed system.

## Status

This is work towards a production version of **Mesh Security**. As of April 2023, this is very
early stage, not even MVP. The goal is to have something for testnets by July 2023.
Please [see the roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for more info.

The original version from HackWasm Medellin can be found at
[CosmWasm/mesh-security-hackathon](https://github.com/CosmWasm/mesh-security-hackathon).
That is actually full-stack end-to-end, but made a lot of design trade-offs for a hackathon.
You can refer to the code as an idea of how the production version will look and if you
learn better from working code than architecture documents.
